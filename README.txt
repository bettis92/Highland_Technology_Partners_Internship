This repository showcases work and projects completed during my internship at Highland Technology Partners, an AI-driven quantitative financial trading organization. My focus was on analyzing trading session results, providing statistical analysis, and offering strategic insights into how their models performed at specific times of the day, particularly on a 30-minute basis from market opening to closing.

The trading data analysis and resampling scripts are the specific tools I created and used for the above-mentioned analysis.

Due to the trading information being the private property of Highland Tech Partners, the training information cannot be included here. However, what I have included are the exact outputs my scripts produced, which you can find in the 'Analysis Outputs' folder.

The 'Practice' folder includes residual artifacts from my learning process and progression, enabling me to operate effectively during the internship. Throughout this internship, I learned to utilize Google Cloud and remote SSH connections. I worked in the Linux command line for the first time and used various bash scripts to partially clean, adjust, and standardize data before sending them to my Python scripts for analysis.
