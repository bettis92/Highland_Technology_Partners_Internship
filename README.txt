This repository showcases work and projects completed during my internship at Highland Technology Partners, an AI-driven quantitative financial trading organization. My focus was on analyzing trading session results, providing statistical analysis, and offering strategic insights into how their active model performed at specific times of the day, particularly on a 30-minute basis from market opening to closing.

The "Trading Data Analysis and Resampling Scripts" are the specific tools I created and used for the above-mentioned analysis.

Due to the trading information being the private property of Highland Tech Partners, the training information cannot be included here. However, what I have included are the exact outputs my scripts produced, which you can find in the 'Analysis Outputs' folder.

The 'CSV Outputs for Visualization' folder just includes the statistical analysis broken down for each 30-minute period, excluding the extra descriptive data added at the end that's included in the analysis outputs. This CSV table can be, and was, loaded into visualization tools like Tableau.

The "Analysis Visualizations" folder showcases the final charts created from the 30-minute window analysis, which visually depict the average profits for each 30-minute window throughout the day. These charts cover each individual month during the 18-month period analyzed, along with a comprehensive chart that aggregates 30-minute profit averages for the entire 18-month duration.

The 'Practice' folder includes residual artifacts from my learning process and progression, enabling me to operate effectively during the internship. Throughout this internship, I learned to utilize Google Cloud and remote SSH connections. I worked in the Linux command line for the first time and used various bash scripts to partially clean, adjust, and standardize data before sending them to my Python scripts for analysis.
